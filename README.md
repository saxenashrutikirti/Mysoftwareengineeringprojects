Project Scope and Feasibility Document was created as part of the semester project in Software Engineering 2: Management, Maintenance and Quality Assurance under the guidance of professor Khalili. This document describes business objectives, system objectives, feasibility concerns, project scope and model, assumptions, constraints and most importantly tasks, schedule and costs related to a project called dealership management web application whose intial outline was presented to us by Dr. Khalili. 
COCOMO Estimation Document calculates costs and schedule associated with dealership management system using COCOMO tool and also the various contributing cost drivers and scale drivers. It also tries to differentiate between two ways of calculating costs and schedule ie Micrososft Project Planner and COCOMO tool. The document concludes through various recommendations for developing the dealership management application. 
Software Engineering Process Document provides the various functionalities, user requirements, high level use cases, use case diagrams, traceability matrix, increment matrix, domain model, expanded use cases (with UI prototypes), sequence diagrams and design class diagrams associated with a mobile quiz application called Quizzie. The youtube link to this application has been provided in the end of document itself. The project was a completed as part of Software Engineering 1 class under the supervision of Professor Miok Siok.
